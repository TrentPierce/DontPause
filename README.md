DontPause
=========

An Android app to keep notifications from interrupting your media on your device.

Dont Pause listens for isMusicPlaying() and when it returns true, Dont Pause will silence your 
notifications to keep them from interrupting your media.


If you happened upon this repo by luck, then I ask that you please refrain from announcing that the app is open source. 
I have some cleaning and commenting to do before I announce it and let others view my work. If you are a brave developer and
want to delve into it anyway, then go right ahead. The program works great, and it looks good. I just want to clean the code
to make it more presentable to the untrained eye.
